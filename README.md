# Honey Tee Web
This is a practice project to showcase what I learned in class about domain and hosting. I designed a simple and quick website for my wife's business - Honey Tee Cosmetics, and I pushed the website live on the domain name earlier purchased in class. My approach: I built the website from scratch using basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap framework. The website features a nav bar with links, two carousels with 15 images in slideshows, and two text divs. The website is highly responsive across various devices ranging from mobile to desktop, all thanks to the mobile-first design of Bootstrap CSS framework. Feel free to check out the live website at https://honeyteecosmetics.name.ng/
